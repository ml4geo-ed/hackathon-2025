# hackathon-2025

Welcome to ML4GEO's inaugaral Ideathon/Hackathon for Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). 

Below we've collated a list of helpful links and tutorials to get you started:

## Foundation Models / Tutorials

  * **TerraTorch**: Built on PyTorch, enables access to multiple vision (TerraMind, Clay, SSL4EO,...) and weather foundation models (Pritvi). Many examples of image classification, downscaling @

  * **TerraMind**: The latest GFM from ESA, can be applied for classical deep learning tasks, as well as generative tasks (e.g. S1 from S2 data)
    *  https://github.com/IBM/ML4EO-workshop-2025
      * Examples of disaster response with S1 and S2; multi-temporal data crop segmentation 

  * **Google Satellite v1 Embeddings**:
    * https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_SATELLITE_EMBEDDING_V1_ANNUAL
    * We have scripts to help download rasters of embeddings with python API

  * **SatCLIP:** Predict location coordinates given satellite imagery
